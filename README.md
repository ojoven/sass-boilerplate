SASS BOILERPLATE
===============================00

This repository works as the Sass base for new projects.

It's a custom Sass boilerplate based on https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate

The structure is like this:
* app/
	* abstracts/ (base files including animations, colors, fonts, media and mixins)
		* _animations.scss
		* _colors.scss
		* _fonts.scss
